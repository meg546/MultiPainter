# MultiPixel

"MultiPixel is an online relaxation video game designed to offer a more enjoyable experience for stressed individuals during their leisure time. Our program is unique as it offers free, easy access to pixel painting software, which can be interacted with anytime, simply through a web browser, helping solve the problem above.
