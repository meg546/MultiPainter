# Contributing

Project Contribution:

-All team member contributions shall be committed on GitHub.

-Pull requests should entail details about the pull being made so other developers understand it.

-Pushes to main should be relatively constant (multiple a week during development phase)
and committed by every team member.

-Current requirements should be created in the form of issues so they may be tracked by developers.

-Reviews and collaboration is required for all changes made and to all commits.
