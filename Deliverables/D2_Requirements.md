# D2 Deliverable

## 1. Positioning

#### Problem statement:
> "The problem of limited creative outlets for relaxation and self-expression on the web affects stressed individuals who can't run or afford a download-based video game; the impact of which is individuals being compelled to engage with web-based games that are poorly made or uninteresting, and downloadable programs that our poorly optimized or overly expensive."

#### Product Position Statement:
> "For individuals experiencing stress who prefer a hassle-free web-based solution over downloadable games, MultiPixel offers a unique online video game experience. Users can unwind and relax by coloring a diverse collection of pixel art drawings using the popular "Color by Numbers" method. What sets MultiPixel apart from other pixel-based coloring games is the ability for users to not only color existing drawings but also create and share their pixel art masterpieces. Our platform features a community hub where users can showcase their creations, allowing others to download and enjoy coloring their artwork, fostering a collaborative and creative community experience. "

## 3. Functional requirements (features) 

Make a numbered list of requirements for your software. Just self-explanatory titles are enough at this point. Remember that requirements should deliver the value proposition and they must be consistent with the interviews you performed for the previous deliverable. You can talk again to your clients to help define the requirements. While writing the requirements, focus on the capabilities needed and not on how they should be implemented.

1. Access to an online database of user creations
2. Universal Theme, Easy to understand UI
3. User Account Services
4. Store user information

## 4. Non-functional requirements

*Non-functional requirements* 

1. Security (Makes sure the site is secure and users don't have to work about stolen information by encrypting all sensitive information and storage)
     - Site data is encrypted and not easily accessed by random users/people
2. Performance (Allows a seamless user experience between all aspects of the site)
     - Website should be smooth and seamless on any device 
3. Portability (Users should be able to use the website on any device that can connect to the site)
     - Game and site work on both a computer and a smartphone through the browser
4. Availability (Site should always be available and not crash often)
     - Site is up all the time
5. Maintainability (Codebase should be well written and commented to allow future upgrades and additions with ease)
     - Code is well commeted and easy to read

## 5. MVP

*MVP:*
A five-by-five grid with colors set to a certain number allows the user to fill in the grid depending on the number in the square with the correct color to complete a drawing. The drawing is to be saved into a database so the user can come back to a drawing later. The entire website will fit into a universal and coherent theme.

The MVP will be tested through prototyping and user testing.

We are going to validate these things first
- Our ability to make and host a website which can be viewed by others
- Our ability to make a working UX/UI the user can interact with with ease
- The system's ability to turn a painting of pixels into a file of numbers that can be sent to the database
- as well as vice versa

Later goals such as workshops, templates, galleries, multiplayer or minigames, Will all be validated in the future,
But our main goal is to validate those concepts above

## 6. Use cases
