# D2 Deliverable

## 1. Positioning

*Problem statement*

Example of a problem statement: “The problem of inefficient prioritization of homework assignments affects college students; the impact of which is delivering assignments past due and receiving low grades.” The problem should read as a problem (must be something bad that makes people spend time or money in an inefficient way.

*Product Position Statement*

A product position statement communicates the intent of the application and the importance of the project to all concerned personnel. The product should mitigate the aforementioned problem. Provide a statement according to the following structure:

*Value proposition and customer segment*

Report the value propositions and customer segments of your product. Make sure that your value proposition is coherent with the product position statement and contains the following elements: i) what your product is; ii) the target customer; iii) the value your product provides; and iv) why your product is unique. See the example:

Consumer segment: College students who have many parallel homework assignments

Grading criteria (3 points, 1 for each section): The content of the subsections should contain all the required elements, follow the provided template, and be consistent with each other. The text should not contain typos or grammar issues.

## 2. Stakeholders

Make a list of all stakeholders of the project with a brief description of each one of them, emphasizing any responsibilities with the project. Examples of stakeholders include users, clients, competitors, detractors, developers, etc.

Grading criteria (1 point): The stakeholders can’t be too generic or specific. The list should reflect what was described in Section 1.

## 3. Functional requirements (features) 

Make a numbered list of requirements for your software. Just self-explanatory titles are enough at this point. Remember that requirements should deliver the value proposition and they must be consistent with the interviews you performed for the previous deliverable. You can talk again to your clients to help define the requirements. While writing the requirements, focus on the capabilities needed and not on how they should be implemented.

1. Access to a online database of user creations
2. Universal Theme, Easy to understand UI
3. User Account Services
4. Store user information

## 4. Non-functional requirements

For each non-functional requirement, give an objective goal/measurement in order to provide verifiability for the requirement.

*Non-functional requirements* 

1. Security (Makes sure site is secure and users dont have to work about stolen information by encrypting all sensitive information and storage)
2. Performance (Allows a seemless user experience between all aspects of the site)
3. Portability (Users should be able to use the website on any device that can connect to the site)
4. Avalability (Site should always be avaliable and not crash often)
5. Maintainablity (Codebase should be well written and commented to allow future upgrades and additions with ease)

Grading criteria (2 points): Follow the ISO-IEC terminology, explain why they are important, provide verifiability criteria for each requirement.

## 5. MVP
What will be your MVP? Which features are you going to validate? How?

*MVP:*
A five by five grid with colors set to a certain number, that allow for the user to fill in the grid depending on the number in the square with the correct color to complete a the drawing. The drawing is to be saved into a database so the user can come back to a drawing later. The entire website will fit into a universal and coherent theme.

The MVP will be tested through prototyping and user testing.

Grading criteria (2 points): Describe what would be considered the Minimal Viable Product and how it will be tested (e.g., via implementation, prototyping, Wizard of Woz, etc.). Make clear what you are going to validate. The MVP should be coherent with the previous sections.

## 6. Use cases
Use case diagram

Include a UML use case diagram for your project. There are many drawing tools that you can use, such as https://app.diagrams.net/ Links to an external site. and https://creately.com/ Links to an external site. 

Grading criteria (5 points): Follow correctly the UML specification. The actors should be coherent with what was listed in sections 1 and 2. The use case diagram should be coherent with the list of requirements (section 3). The level of granularity of each use case should be adequate. The use cases should be adequately named.

Use case descriptions and interface sketch

Present one complete use case description for each member of the group. Therefore, if the group has 4 members, 4 use case descriptions are necessary. As the grading will not be individual, the group is responsible for keeping the quality and consistency of the whole document – avoid just splitting the work. Choose the most important use cases to describe. Follow the template provided in the Lecture slides to describe the use cases.

After each use case description, add a sketch of the corresponding user interface. This will be a good opportunity to start thinking about usability. 

Grading criteria (8 points): Follow the template to describe the use cases. Present an interface sketch for each use case. Describe the use case as a dialog between the user and the system. Do not use UI language in the description of the use case.

## 7. User stories
Establish a priority level for each user story and estimate how many hours each one will demand using the planning poker approach. 

Grading criteria (6 points): Use the provided format. The user stories should be in an adequate level of granularity (not too broad nor too specific). Provide the priority and estimation for each user story.

##### Matthew:

- As a user, I want to be able to see all the pixel painting I have completed so far, so that I can come back and look at my completed work. 
    - Priority:
    - Estimation: 
- As a user I want to have the ability to comment on others painting that they have published, so that I can interact with other users and make a nice community.

## 8. Issue Tracker
The user stories should be registered in your GitHub issue tracker. Include here the link for your issue tracker and a screenshot of what you did. 

Grading criteria (1 point): Provide the URL and screenshot of the issue tracker. The user stories should be registered there.
