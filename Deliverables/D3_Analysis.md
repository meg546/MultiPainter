# 1. System Description
Multipixel is a project that is being designed to provide a creative outlet for stressed out creative users. 
There is a limited outlet for creative users that is affordable, web-based, and simple. Multipixel provides 
such a game for individuals experiencing stress who prefer a hassle-free web-based
solution over downloadable games. Users can unwind and relax by coloring a diverse collection
of pixel art drawings using the popular "Color by Numbers" method. What sets
MultiPixel apart from other pixel-based coloring games is the ability for users to
not only color existing drawings but also create and share their pixel art
masterpieces. Users are able to, in their free time, relax online while making expressing their creative
freedom and foster a community of other creative individuals at varying levels. 

Functional requirements

When designing this project, it is important to think about the different users that are at stake such
as different players of our game that include users who are artists and want relaxing, 
and web-based games. Different competitors such as other pixel-based games (ie. Coloring Pixels, Aseprite) 
and in class web games (ie. slither.io, chess, scribble.io) that other students play. As developers 
we are at stake along with our hosting service, AWS, and our graphic designer, Sam Beach. The distractors
of our project would be anyone disliking in-class games, pixel-based games, artistic games and solo games.
Our boss, Ana Paula Chaves is also at statke in that we have a working minimum viable product (MVP) that
meets her standards of the outlined software engineering requirements. 

The important part of designing a project to consider is the functional requiremetns. We had to rework our functional
requirments from D2, as we had a limmited understanding of what was requires

	Our use cases included Create Unique Pixel Art, Sign in, Adjust game settings, Follow Pixel Art Template, and View the community workshop. Signing in is fundamental as a use case because it grants users access to personalized features and interactions related to content sharing. The settings ability empowers users to customize their art, graphics, and control the interface. The pixel art template as well as the community workshop abilities create a community that encourages collaboration about the art that is being made. Challenges, collaboration, and galleries contribute to the webpage's ecosystem. Describing these use cases allows us as developers to refine the layout and steps for designing the webpage in  a way that it is easily accepted by users in the use cases.

user stories





After getting user stories from various stakeholders, it is clear that there is functionality that is needed for
our client-base to enjoy the game. The feed will be a huge functionality since it allows users to search for paintings
by tag or they can scroll and find paintings to play. This will allow our availability of paintings to grow quickly.
Since there is a create template for people to design their own, the ability to have accounts will allow users to sign
in, create their painting, and upload to the feed. Accounts will also allow users to save their paintings to their 
account and make sure that they can go back and see the drawings they have created in a personal feed functionality
from their own portfolio. It is clear that along with this, if users for whatever reason want more drawings, 
they need to be able to delete them from their account. Flexibility while creating art is something users crave
for multiple purposes. They need a palette to allow color variability and to be able to change the template size
so that they can add more detail to their art. Other settings would allow for users with disabilities to be included
in our pixel-painting community by allowing settings for text-size changing and a colorblind palette that allows color
blind users to interact with everyone in the community who may not be colorblind. 

# 2. Model
Provide the conceptual model of your system as a UML class diagram. Represent proper cardinalities (multiplicities) for all associations. Also include the association names. 

 Some points to consider:

Use UML adequately. Do not use graphical elements that are not part of the language. Represent compositions and aggregations when relevant. 
This model is not an ER diagram (entity-relationship model), which is focused on relational database systems. However, both diagrams have similarities. 
Do not overcomplicate how you represent the elements of your model (e.g., using inheritance or an association when they are not necessary). Pay attention to simplicity, maintainability, unnecessary repetition, cohesion, and coupling.
Do not represent actions that don’t need to be registered in the system. 
Do not represent technical elements, such as user interface or programming language libraries in the model. At this point, we are modeling the business logic/domain of your system. During the design phase, the model will be refined to include technology-specific elements and decisions. 
Do not represent "System" as a class in your model. Everything that you are modeling is part of the system.
If you feel the need to justify your decisions, you can write your rationale in this section or as UML comments in the diagram.
The model must have at least 8 classes. You can add requirements in the system description if you need more classes. 

Grading criteria: You should correctly use the UML specification. Your model should have the minimum number of classes. Your domain should be adequately modeled. The model should avoid unnecessary complexity, repetition, lack of cohesion, and coupling. The classes should be at an adequate abstraction level.
