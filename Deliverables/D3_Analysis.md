In this deliverable, report the results of the software analysis for your project. Use the following sections to structure your deliverable. See the “Team Project Instructions” for details about formatting. 

# 1. System Description
Multipixel is a project that is being designed to provide a creative outlet for stressed out creative users. 
There is a limited outlet for creative users that is affordable, web-based, and simple. Multipixel provides 
such a game for individuals experiencing stress who prefer a hassle-free web-based
solution over downloadable games. Users can unwind and relax by coloring a diverse collection
of pixel art drawings using the popular "Color by Numbers" method. What sets
MultiPixel apart from other pixel-based coloring games is the ability for users to
not only color existing drawings but also create and share their pixel art
masterpieces. Users are able to, in their free time, relax online while making expressing their creative
freedom and foster a community of other creative individuals at varying levels. 

When designing this project, it is important to think about the different users that are at stake such
as different players of our game that include users who are artists and want relaxing, 
and web-based games. Different competitors such as other pixel-based games (ie. Coloring Pixels, Aseprite) 
and in class web games (ie. slither.io, chess, scribble.io) that other students play. As developers 
we are at stake along with our hosting service, AWS, and our graphic designer, Sam Beach. The distractors
of our project would be anyone disliking in-class games, pixel-based games, artistic games and solo games.
Our boss, Ana Paula Chaves is also at statke in that we have a working minimum viable product (MVP) that
meets her standards of the outlined software engineering requirments. 

# 2. Model
Provide the conceptual model of your system as a UML class diagram. Represent proper cardinalities (multiplicities) for all associations. Also include the association names. 

 Some points to consider:

Use UML adequately. Do not use graphical elements that are not part of the language. Represent compositions and aggregations when relevant. 
This model is not an ER diagram (entity-relationship model), which is focused on relational database systems. However, both diagrams have similarities. 
Do not overcomplicate how you represent the elements of your model (e.g., using inheritance or an association when they are not necessary). Pay attention to simplicity, maintainability, unnecessary repetition, cohesion, and coupling.
Do not represent actions that don’t need to be registered in the system. 
Do not represent technical elements, such as user interface or programming language libraries in the model. At this point, we are modeling the business logic/domain of your system. During the design phase, the model will be refined to include technology-specific elements and decisions. 
Do not represent "System" as a class in your model. Everything that you are modeling is part of the system.
If you feel the need to justify your decisions, you can write your rationale in this section or as UML comments in the diagram.
The model must have at least 8 classes. You can add requirements in the system description if you need more classes. 

Grading criteria: You should correctly use the UML specification. Your model should have the minimum number of classes. Your domain should be adequately modeled. The model should avoid unnecessary complexity, repetition, lack of cohesion, and coupling. The classes should be at an adequate abstraction level.
