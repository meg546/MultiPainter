### Interview 2:

**Summary:** Prefers a relaxing game where it can be played during class. Multiplayer is not something he would play. It is a game that doesn't need a leaderboard, but what would be nice is that it could help him go back to revisit old paintings. A stardew valley like music track would be nice, but he probably wouldn't listen to it a lot.
