Group 04 – "MultiPixel"\
Date and location: Feb 11, 2024\
Group Members: Aidan Trujillo, Hunter Beach, Colton Leighton, Mathew Gardner, Thomas Rotchford

## 1. Introduction

Hunter: I changed this a little, review if y'all think it's good-

Our team has decided to develop a web-based game called MultiPixel for our project. This pixel coloring game draws inspiration from the childhood activity “Coloring by Numbers”. In MultiPixel, users can select from a variety of pre-made pixel art and fill in the colors. drawing inspiration from the nostalgic childhood activity of coloring by numbers. Users will be presented with a variety of styles and themes to bring to life, from animals to nature to famous paintings, we intend to provide as many canvases as one could desire. Our goal is to give them a relaxing place to paint pixel art pieces, allowing them to choose and fill in the colors they desire.

In website design, accessibility is our top priority, ensuring a seamless and enjoyable experience for users on both computers and mobile devices. One of our main goals will be to make everything streamlined with as little lag as possible and to provide a better experience to users. To further enhance the user experience, the website will include sound effects (SFX) and maintain a consistent stylistic theme throughout, to help the user feel more enthralled in the game. Additionally, users will have the flexibility to toggle SFX with a slider, so they can enjoy the site how they please.

Additionally, we plan to introduce a community workshop feature. This feature aims to empower users not only to enjoy pre-made pixel art but also to create and share their designs on a dedicated community page. This collaborative platform will facilitate users in sharing their artwork for views, as well as their paint-by-number canvases for others to use. We wish to cultivate a community of appreciating and interacting with each other's artwork, enabling actions such as liking, commenting, downloading, and filling in others' designs. Integrating user accounts and the community workshop significantly enhances the overall MultiPixel experience, blending individual creativity with community engagement, and offering a good way to save completed works in our databases

As for gold plating, our interviews have shown a major market in multiplayer game modes competitive or cooperative. We have plans for going about both, by way of a divided board, allowing easy multiplayer play to help further the multiplayer community
