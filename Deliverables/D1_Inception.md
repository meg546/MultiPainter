Group 04 – "MultiPixel"\
Date and location: Feb 11, 2024\
Group Members: Aidan Trujillo, Hunter Beach, Colton Leighton, Mathew Gardner, Thomas Rotchford

## 1. Introduction

Our team has decided on developing a web-based game called MultiPixel for our project. This pixel coloring game draws inspiration from the childhood activity “Coloring by numbers”. In MultiPixel, users can select from a variety of pre-made pixel art and fill in the colors. drawing inspiration from the nostalgic childhood activity of coloring by numbers. In MultiPixel, users are presented with a variety of pre-made pixel art pieces, allowing them to choose and fill in the colors as they desire.

In designing the website, accessibility is our top priority, ensuring a seamless and enjoyable experience for users on both computers and mobile devices. To further enhance the user experience, the website will include sound effects (SFX) and maintain a consistent theme throughout. Additionally, users will have the flexibility to toggle music on or off, along with the convenience of adjusting the volume using a slider.

Additionally, we plan to introduce a community workshop feature. This feature aims to empower users not only to enjoy pre-made pixel art but also to create and share their own designs on a dedicated community page. This collaborative platform will facilitate users in appreciating and interacting with each other's artwork, enabling actions such as liking, commenting, downloading, and even filling in others' designs themselves. The integration of both user accounts and the community workshop significantly enhances the overall MultiPixel experience, blending individual creativity with community engagement.
