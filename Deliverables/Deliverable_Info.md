Deliverable Format and Submission

Each deliverable must be written as a GitHub .md (markdown) file and made available on your repository. All headers should be larger text and bolded to stand out.

Updates to the deliverable: Every team member should update the deliverable via a pull request. This pull request should be reviewed by the archivist, who should approve and integrate the change. All the other members can and should review each other’s work as well. The group needs to plan carefully to have time for these reviews. Remember: no contribution should be integrated without review, at least by the archivist. The previous archivist should review the pull requests of the current one.

Submission for grading: After the team finishes the document, the archivist person should: 

copy the .md document to a “Submitted” folder inside the folder “Deliverables” on GitHub and create a pull request to submit this change.
In the first submission, make sure that the instructor and teaching staff have been added to the repository --- find their GitHub on About your Instructor page.
write in the comment box of the pull request the description of the participation of each member of the group. In this description, you should briefly summarize what each member of the group has done and a rough percentage of the workload for that specific deliverable. I expect a fair distribution of work among the members of the team. Members with very low participation compared to others may receive a lower grade. You don’t need to be very precise in the percentage, I rough estimate is fine. Example of comment:
John Doe (40%) – Conducted 2 interviews, wrote section 2.3, and reviewed the whole document.
Mary Shawn (40%) – Conducted 1 interview, wrote sections 1 and 2.1, reviewed section 2.3, and worked on the source code.
Lucy Johnson (20%) – Wrote section 2.2 and performed code review.
submit to Canvas:
the URL of the pull request to the corresponding assignment on Canvas (you can find the assignment on the Team Project module)
a pdf of the rendered document
Deliverables submitted in discordance with these instructions can incur a penalty of up to 20%.

Instructor’s review cycle: The instructor and teaching staff will review the pull request and request changes if needed. The grade will be “zero” until all change requests are completed. If you received change requests: 

Your group has a week to implement the changes or until the final exam date, whatever comes first. The changes should be done to the same original pull request.
Submit again the URL of the pull request to Canvas (same assignment).
The instructor and teaching staff will review again the pull request and can request another round of changes. If you received more change requests, go back to step 1. 
There will be only 2 rounds of change requests. After the third submission or if the group misses the deadline, the deliverable will be graded based only on the accepted sections. Sections will incomplete or inadequate changes (at the instructor’s discretion) will typically receive zero points.
