Weekly Meetings

Starting in the second meeting, the minute for all the weekly meetings should include:

Initial information: group, project, date/time, location, participants, roles, repository, activity tracker, and duration.
Summary of activities: record the activities completed by each member since the last meeting. Remember that coding activity is expected every week. 
Project retrospective: Make at least five lists: 
appreciations (highlights of contributions from team members)
successes (what went well)
what didnâ€™t go so well
barriers (things that are blocking the maximum performance of the team)
what we should try next time.
Planning: 
 

Planning of the next steps
Think about what needs to be done and assign tasks. Update your shared Activity Tracker spreadsheet with the new tasks. Update the spreadsheet with actual hours spent in the activities, corresponding GitHub issues, and the status of the work
