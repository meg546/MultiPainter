# D2 Deliverable

## 1. Positioning

#### Problem statement:
> "The problem of limited creative outlets for relaxation and self-expression on the web affects stressed individuals who can't run or afford a download-based video game; the impact of which is individuals being compelled to engage with web-based games that are poorly made or uninteresting, and downloadable programs that our poorly optimized or overly expensive."

#### Product Position Statement:
> "For individuals experiencing stress who prefer a hassle-free web-based solution over downloadable games, MultiPixel offers a unique online video game experience. Users can unwind and relax by coloring a diverse collection of pixel art drawings using the popular "Color by Numbers" method. What sets MultiPixel apart from other pixel-based coloring games is the ability for users to not only color existing drawings but also create and share their pixel art masterpieces. Our platform features a community hub where users can showcase their creations, allowing others to download and enjoy coloring their artwork, fostering a collaborative and creative community experience. "

#### Value proposition and customer segment:
> "MultiPixel is an online relaxation video game designed to offer a more enjoyable experience for stressed individuals during their leisure time.  Our program is unique as it offers free, easy access to pixel painting software, which can be interacted with anytime, simply through a web browser, helping solve the problem above. Additionally, it fosters a sense of community through a workshop feature where users can showcase their creations, allowing others to download and enjoy coloring their artwork."

> Stressed individuals who can't run or afford a download-based video game

## 2. Stakeholders

As for stakeholders, we have 5 major groups to look into. First is the People who will play the game. These stakeholders will influence our project by giving it a player base, giving our game popularity, and will be our main impetus for developing this program. Second, we have Developers / Systems. These stakeholders will influence our project by giving it form, without these stakeholders our project will have nothing to stand on. Third, we have our clients and our boss. These stakeholders will give us a review, and instruct us on what segments of our program ought to be changed. Fourth, we have the competitors. These stakeholders will be the program we need to compete against. We need to find what makes other pixel art software  or web-based games successful, take those aspects for ourselves, and find what other competitors lack, and offer that in our project. Lastly, we have distractors. These are people who think they might like our game but are incorrect. They may unknowingly dislike, web-based, artistic, or relaxing games, but might blame it on our product, so we need to recognize these stakeholders to better understand our review

## 4. Non-functional requirements

*Non-functional requirements* 

1. Security (Makes sure the site is secure and users cannot access other users' profiles. All sensitive information is encrypted and locked on the database)
     - User names and passwords stored on the database
        - Have these values and other sensitive information encrypted and locked
            - Can only be accessed by us 5 admins via passcode
     - 
3. Performance (Allows a seamless user experience between all aspects of the site)
     - Website should have specific UI/UX options set up for each different type of device display
     - Website should load any page within less than 2 seconds, especially when receiving data from the database
     - Program to save an image, convert it to a number-based .txt file, and upload it to the database should take less than 10 seconds
     - If we receive any reports of bugs or lag or broken displays, we will go fix them
     - A new user can use any functionality in the software without error
     - No buttons or links will lead to the wrong areas
       
4. Portability (Users should be able to use the website on any device that can connect to the site)
     - Game and site work on both a computer and a smartphone through the browser
     - All different displays should also have all functions listed above

5. Availability (Site should almost always be available, and not crash minimally)
     - The site Will be up 90% of the time, considering we are still in the working phase
     - This gives us 18 days of general unavailability for this semester
     - As such we will have it not running, for at most 18 days.
     - Any crash reports we will fix in less than 7 days
      
6. Maintainability (Codebase should be written and commented to allow future upgrades and additions with ease)

       - Every Line of code will have at least one comment explaining its use
       - Certain blocks will have flags showing where they start and stop
         - IE <!-- HEADER START --> code here <!-- HEADER END -->
       - Every function or cohesive block will have a comment above explaining its purpose
     - We will maintain this code-writing technique for clarity
        - We will have a blank line in between lines of code
        - we will follow NAU's GUR for indentations and brackets

## 5. MVP

Our MVP will be the combination of the following aspects of our Functional requirements:

1. Menu homepage allowing access to several options
   - Button to view your portfolio
   - Buttons for each type of Pixel Art
     - Draw on a clear grid
     - Draw on a template
   - Options tab for UI/UX
3. Ability to draw on grid/template
   - 16 base colors to choose from on the left
   - Resizable x by x grid on right
   - Tab for grid options, including resizing
   - button for saving the grid
   - button for loading new templates
   - Menu option to switch back
5. Ability to save a portfolio of projects
   - Save Project
   - Delete Project
4. Ability to control UI/UX
   - SFX variability

In normal English, we want to implement a homepage with 4 main buttons, one for a clear grid, one for a template, one for a portfolio, and one for options. The clear grid and the template will be functionally the same, just with different canvases to draw on. On our drawing page, we will have 16 colors on to choose from and a resizable grid to draw on. We will have a tab for grif options including resizing, a button for loading new templates, and a button for saving the artwork. Next, we will have a portfolio visible where you can view your saved artwork. Lastly, we will have a settings tab, which will allow the user to affect SFX, by turning sound or music lower or higher.
These function requirements seem most important to implement for us to consider our product as a Pixel Art game.
